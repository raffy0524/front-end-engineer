                    New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island.
                    The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York what is known as
                    the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Liberty Island and commonly visited by tourists. However, it took
                    10 years to assemble and therefore wasnâ€™t unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square
                    is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was named after The
                    New York Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also
                    known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.
